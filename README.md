# MaisHackCovidSegmentation-
We used a unet model to do covid image segmentation and built a app to deply this model to a user. 
The training of the code is located here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IKG1SnVoQDJIi0XAMd1w5IYKZBZKYD1Z?usp=sharing
I couldn't manage to upload our best serialized model but the model was serialized in the colab notebook and you can try to dowload the file and serialize it 
to get the best serialized model.
